	"content": "Welcome to XIVEventBuddy! To help you get started here is the breakdown of how this bot works.\n\nThe first thing you will want to do is use the {{settingsCommandMention}} to configure the role(s) that will be able to create events with the {{eventsCommandMention}} command.\n\nUntil such time only the people with the $t(permissions:Administrator) permission, or the person who is the server owner, will be able to use the bot.\nNote that it is these same people who will be able to use the {{settingsCommandMention}} command.\n\nLastly if you are reading this in English you should know that the bot supports multiple languages and can be configured to use your preferred language. You can do this by enabling \"Community\" on your Discord server and then configuring the \"Server Primary Language\" under \"Community Overview\".\n\nIf you need any further assistance, or you have any other questions, please feel free to join the support server using the button below."
