## About

Bloombot is a private Discord bot for the Nightbloom FFXIV Free Company Discord server to provide various utilities and
event management. We have opted to make our own bot to provide a more tailored experience for our members.

## Developing on Bloombot

### Requirements

- [`Node.js`]: To run the project.
- [`Postgres`]: A persistent storage database database.
- [`Redis`]: Scheduling tasks.

### [Set-Up - Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md]

## A note to aspiring developers who want to self host Bloombot

The developer team does not support the idea of other self-hosted instances of Bloombot. The team prides itself on
providing the best experience and support for the end-users. As such, an offshoot or unaffiliated mirror of Bloombot may
cause ill effects to the reputation and image of Bloombot. If you wish to see new features implemented, please refer to
the developing guidelines linked above.

In addition, Bloombot was built with a dependence on many services which need consistent maintenance and oversight in
order to function and behave properly. These include, but are not limited to,

- [`Postgres`]: A persistent storage database database
- [`Redis`]: Caching of queries and scheduling tasks.

With this in mind, it is also worth noting that Bloombot will in no way be capable of running on services such as
[Glitch] or [Heroku]. A dedicated VPS (Virtual Private Server) is required in order to maintain the proper production
environment.
