## About

XIVEventBuddy is a Discord bot that lets you host your FFXIV events on your Discord server. This bot aims to be user
friendly and it will never lock any features behind a paywall.

new translations (or improving existing ones), [**click here**](https://crowdin.com/project/xiveventbuddy). Thank you in
advance for any contributions!

## Developing on XIVEventBuddy

### Requirements

- [`Node.js`]: To run the project.
- [`Postgres`]: A persistent storage database database.
- [`Redis`]: Scheduling tasks.

### [Set-Up - Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md]

## A note to aspiring developers who want to self host XIVEventBuddy

The developer team does not support the idea of other self-hosted instances of XIVEventBuddy. The team prides itself on
providing the best experience and support for the end-users. As such, an offshoot or unaffiliated mirror of
XIVEventBuddy may cause ill effects to the reputation and image of XIVEventBuddy. If you wish to see new features
implemented, please refer to the developing guidelines linked above.

In addition, XIVEventBuddy was built with a dependence on many services which need consistent maintenance and oversight
in order to function and behave properly. These include, but are not limited to,

- [`Postgres`]: A persistent storage database database
- [`Redis`]: Caching of queries and scheduling tasks.

With this in mind, it is also worth noting that XIVEventBuddy will in no way be capable of running on services such as
[Glitch] or [Heroku]. A dedicated VPS (Virtual Private Server) is required in order to maintain the proper production
environment.
